## JS Framework Wrappers

We strive to make it easy to use Shepherd in all the major frameworks, and have written wrappers to facilitate this.

* [angular-shepherd](https://github.com/shipshapecode/angular-shepherd)
* [ember-shepherd](https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-shepherd)
* [react-shepherd](https://github.com/shipshapecode/react-shepherd)
* [vue-shepherd](https://github.com/shipshapecode/vue-shepherd)

## Install Directly

### npm

```bash
npm install shepherd.js --save
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add shepherd.js
```

### GitHub Releases

Whenever we release a new version, the contents of the `dist` are uploaded
to the release in GitHub. You can find those assets [here](https://github.com/shipshapecode/shepherd/releases).

### jsDelivr CDN

You can use jsDelivr to pull down any release from npm. For example, you could include v5.0.1 in your app
with:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/shepherd.js@5.0.1/dist/js/shepherd.js"></script>
```
